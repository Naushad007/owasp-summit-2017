In addition to providing high value actionable information, a good SOC will allow provide a wealth of valuable metrics and visualisations for the business (from user activities/behaviour to to system performance)

## What

 - What are the the key technical and operational components of SOCs
 - Map examples of SOC implementations (people, process and technologies)

 - Best practices in using tools like ELK or Splunk
 - Securing SOCs data and infrastucture
 - Business case for a larger SOC which is sponsored by other business unit (i.e. not just Security)
 - How to use Machine Learning and AI to improve data capture and analysis
 - How to use Business Intelligence techniques and Big Data tools to improve analysis and visualisations
 - Using AppSensor to feed data into SOC and to respond to analysis results

    - Malware infection
    - Web Injection attack
